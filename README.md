#### Lesson Summary:

A quick recap of hypothesis testing leads the way to a discussion on Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing. Students solve a quick example where they have to state what Type 1 and 2 errors are in a particular scenario. Effect size is discussed next,   

#### Topic:

Relational Databases

#### Prerequisite knowledge:

* Students should be able to set null and alternative hypotheses. 
* Students should be able to perform z-tests and t-tests using Python. 
* Students can explain the difference between z-tests and t-tests and know when to apply each to different problems.
